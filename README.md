# NLP-Text-Generation-with-Python-and-Keras-
### Text Generation with Neural Networks

The aim of this project is, given a sequence of words, the algorithm should be able to predict the next word that's if we
have a sequence of 25 words for example, it should tell us the 26th word after we will evaluate the accuracy.

### Steps

We'll start by text `processing` after that we `read the Text`, `Tokenize the Text and create sequences with Keras`.
This sequence now should be formated into a numerical system that keras can understand. The next step will be To convert
the sequence into numpy matrix and create a model and create an `LSTM based model` followed by Training and testing the 
Model.
